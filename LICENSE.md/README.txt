This is my second ZX81 clone, the first one ZX81plus35 I designed three years ago, and it worked fine, the only problem was that it was built from SMT components, and many people complained that they were afraid they wouldn be able to solder SMT components.
So I designed this new clone, which should fit inside an original ZX81 case and only uses readily available components in DIP (pin through hole) packages.
